# IoT Temperature Sensor
![sensor_display](https://github.com/meiyizheng/IoT-tempsensor/blob/master/sensor_display.png)

Building interactive personal appliances requires us to be able to communicate with the types of sensors, indicators and actuators that can be connected to such systems. 

In this project we will create applications that run in an embedded system, read data from external sensors, and log the results. Real world devices of this kind are commonly networked.

- lab4c_tcp.c: a C program that builds and runs on Beaglebone and communicates with a logging server. 

- lab4c_tls.c: a C program that builds and runs on Beaglebone and authenticate TLS session encryption.

- Makefile: default - build program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options)
    clean - delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
    dist - create the deliverable tarball

- README.md: descriptions of each of the included files.
